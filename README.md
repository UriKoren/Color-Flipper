## How It Works
In fact, in the toolbar above I built two options to choose from: 
simple, hex.
 - simple: by clicking the click me button, a simple random color is selected.
 - hex: by clicking on click me, a random color is selected based on a combination of 6 digits in hexadecimal


## What did I learn from the project?
I built this game to sharpen my skills in JS, HTML, CSS as part of an online course that I am studying in self-study, so that I could learn MERN STACK more easily so it was like a prep project for me.
